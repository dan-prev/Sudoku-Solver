Sudoku-Solver is a graphical application built with Python’s Tkinter library that allows users to input and solve Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. If the puzzle is solvable, the completed solution is displayed in the grid; if not, an error message is shown.

The entire project is contained in a single file, sudoku_solver.py, which includes both the graphical interface and the solving logic. To use the app, simply enter numbers into the grid (leaving unknown cells blank), click the “Solve” button to find the solution, or click “Clear” to reset the grid and start over.

To get started, make sure Python is installed on your system. Tkinter is included with most standard Python distributions, so no additional setup is usually required. Clone the repository using:

git clone

python sudoku_solver.py
